    "Recommendation systems are prevalent throughout everyones day to day usage of the internet. Understanding the realtionships betweet the particular items in datasets it extremely useful, thus I wanted to have a strong understanding of how they function and the proper way to build such systems. The data set examined to build these systems is historical movie ratings. These ratings are based on a 1 to 5 scale. I wanted to examine trends within the data set to identify film titles related to those previously rated by users. "

This was done by first merging the data sets and secondly by creating a matrix of each individual user rating and the related movie title. To narrow down titles with a statistically significan number of ratings I narrowed down the data set to only see film titles with more than 100 ratings. "
