    "I was particularly interested in this project as in 2008 during the largest housing crash in US history I was working in that particular industry. I was one of the lucky ones who didn't actually lose my job as a 20ish year old. I was working for a company that specialized in the management of forclosed properties and business was booming, with millions of dollars of new real estate entering my inventory on a weekly basis. Many of these homes were built and sold for $300,000+ only a few years prior and now were sitting on virtually worthless land waiting to be bought for pennies on the dollar by investment groups. \n",

Certain columns I knew were not going to be relevant to my analysis were dropped as well as simplifying the data column to a more model friendly format, creating a number value for each specific data as opposed to trying to standardize a date field, which is time consuming and not particularly necessary.
